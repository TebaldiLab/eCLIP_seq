This folder contains the scripts and R notebooks necessary to identify and compare protein-RNA interaction locations, starting from aligned reads (BAM files). In the simplest experimental design, CLIP and INPUT libraries with ideally 2 or more biological replicates are expected. The case study is an Ago2 eCLIP dataset, obtained from the cytoplasmic fractions of mouse whole testis cells.
